          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am interested in learning Backend with other language like Java, Go or with Python. I also want to know how to make a video game with Unity or other and I am very interested in being a content creator whether programming or something else.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            For now I'm learning how to make applications with real time communication such as a chat using Socket.IO, I'm also starting to learn the way to be Devops using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or others.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am also interested in learning other things besides programming such as 3D design with Blender and video editing with Davinci Resolve (these last two I would take as a hobby).
